Greetings, our honored Commander!
The Elders have decided to finally migrate our people from this dying world. To accomplish this a sacred teleportation ritual has to be performed. It's ingredients are scattered over the remains of this world and need to be gathered to the ritual site before the time runs out. You were chosen to do this with your might army.
